# animate.scss
__Animate.css but customizable.__

`animate.scss` is a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations create by Daneden (<http://daneden.me/animate>). Unfortunatly, it doesn't allow you to create custom animations, based on animate.css animations using simple parameters.

You don't want to add all animations from animate.css in your project when you use only 2 or 3 of them? You want to use animations from animate.css but want to be able to change some parameters on the fly? Animate.scss is made for you.

Animate.scss output only used animations allowing you to keep a light css file for your animations if you only use 2 or 3 of them.

## Usage

```
#id, .class, %extend-only{
    @include fadeIn($animation, $parameter, [$other_parameter, ...]);
}
```

`fadeIn` is the name of the animate.css animation you want to use.

`$animation` represent string use in CSS3 animation property value, without animation-name property. (example: "1000ms ease 0ms 1 normal both"). Here's [some](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation.asp) [doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation).
You can also use the default animate.css value using the string "default".

`$parameter` represent parameters of the given animation. See wiki for a list of parameters for each animation of animate.css.

## Custom animations

Want to add your animation in animate.scss? There is a folder for that.

Add your custom animation in folder `source/_custom` using `default_animation.scss` as model. Then, import it in `source/_custom/_import.scss` file and you're good to go.

### Any suggestion? Go for it!

Animate.scss needs at least Sass 3.3.0 to work properly.
